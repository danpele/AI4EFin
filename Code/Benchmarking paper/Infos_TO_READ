Experiments for the benchmarking paper

The df.csv is derived from the two French datasets:
   Datasets/FR Energy Production
   Datasets/FR Energy production_part2

Remarks:
- the original French production dataset has 49 MB
- the limit for a csv file on GitHub is 25 MB
- so I split in two the data
- the df.csv has about 9MB (I kept the main French production variables and the French price from Entso-e
